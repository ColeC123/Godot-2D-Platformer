Platformer Game:
This stores the code for the tutorial followed for creating a platformer in the Godot Game Engine in my computer programming class. 

Labyrinth of the Wild:
This is my own version of a platformer game using the knowledge I gained from following the tutorial video. A video file displaying the game is attached to this repository, or it can be accessed on [google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XL9v8HF4svUTc_ISoX3VETudFgZ1cqqY/view?usp=sharing)
